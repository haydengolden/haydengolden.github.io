	<h1>Zug Collective is a free-range, performative re/search collective that serves as a platform for addressing issues of social and cultural transformation.  Our work is collaborative (we are not autonomous, self-contained individuals) and non-hierarchical (we respect difference by weaving it into the process).  Our projects come from disparate moments and geographic locations, and reflect an ethos that connects cultural production with community engagement.  We look for cracks in the pavement.  We co-create and cross pollinate. We propagate a sense of place.
